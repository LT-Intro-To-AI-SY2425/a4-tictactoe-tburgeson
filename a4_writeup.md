# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part was making the method that checks if a player won, because of all the different winning scenarios.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would probably use a randomizer and have the CPU pick sections that the human player hasn't chosen.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I'm not entirely sure how I would do this, but it might be able to look for combinations that players frequently use to win games and play in a way that evades those strategic moves.
